## About
AxieBuilder is a webapp in development that tries to help AxieInfinity players choose their teams by giving them more information about card/body parts and their effects on gameplay.
Right now it's on a very early stage of development, and I'm creating this as a side project.
Feel free to open any issues.

## Planned Features
Save your teams so other players can check it out
Visual representation of your Axie
Show every possible damage/defense combo for each Axie and for the whole team
Simulated battles where you can test out your team against other teams
More statistics and data
